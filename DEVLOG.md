### Revised Sprint Plan (Feb 21-27)
| Day | Date | Focus |
|-----|------|-------|
| 3 | Feb 21 (Sat) | Deploy to Render, test real outbound call |
| 4 | Feb 22 (Sat) | Neo4j setup + seed data (T6, T7) |
| 5 | Feb 23 (Sun) | Demo flow (T5) + Yutori integration (T10) |
| 6 | Feb 24 (Mon) | Live updates (T9) + minimal auth (T8) |
| 7 | Feb 25 (Tue) | Landing page polish + bug fixes |
| 8 | Feb 26 (Wed) | Pitch deck + rehearse + final fixes |
| 🏆 | Feb 27 (Thu) | Hackathon: Modulate on-site, demo, win |

### Key Risk
Still haven't made a real outbound call. Render deploy (T3 config done, needs actual deploy) is gate for testing the full voice flow. Priority #1 tomorrow.

## Feb 20, 2025 (Day 2 of 9) - Friday

### Done
- **T1: Voice Agent Rewrite ✅**
  - Rewrote `src/services/voice.ts`: callNegotiationMap now stores instructions + negotiationId
  - AI assistant gets bill-specific context on `call.answered`
  - Added webhook handlers: `call.ai.assistant.transcript`, `.completed`, `.error`
  - Fixed voice setting (invalid Minimax → `matthew`)
  - Fixed variable declaration bug + `call_controlId` typo
  - Compiles clean

- **T2: Telnyx Account Setup ✅** (done Day 1)
  - API key, phone number (+14155491552), Call Control connection, Tavily key

- **Yutori API Research**
  - Researched sponsor's API (1 judge, chief scientist)
  - Simple REST, API key auth, Browsing + Research endpoints
  - Added `research/yutori-integration.md`
  - Added T10 to sprint plan, updated README + .env.example

- **T3: Render Deploy Config** (in progress, GLM-5 working on it)

### Blocked
- **Testing voice agent**: Cloudflare outage preventing all Telnyx API calls
  - `GET /v2/ai/assistants` returns 522 then full timeout
  - Code compiles but payload format unvalidated against real API
  - Will test once Cloudflare recovers

### Sprint Status (7 days to hackathon)
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T1: Voice Agent | ✅ Code done | Untested (Cloudflare down) |
| T2: Account Setup | ✅ Done | Creds ready |
| T3: Render Deploy | 🔄 In progress | GLM-5 building render.yaml |
| T5: Demo Flow | ⬜ Not started | Day 4 (Feb 23) |
| T6: Neo4j Setup | ⬜ Not started | Day 3 (Feb 22) |
| T10: Yutori Integration | ⬜ Not started | Day 4 (Feb 23) |

### API Testing (evening)
- Cloudflare recovered. Tested against real Telnyx API.
- `GET /v2/ai/assistants` returns 200 ✅ (20 existing assistants on account)
- `POST /v2/ai/assistants` successfully created "Slash Bill Negotiator" ✅
  - Assistant ID: `assistant-23365f00-7e4e-4be6-9260-3d190c48ebbb`
  - Voice: `Minimax.speech-2.8-turbo.English_SadTeen` (confirmed valid)
  - Model: `openai/gpt-4o`
  - Transcription: `deepgram/flux`
- Reverted voice setting from `matthew` back to `Minimax.speech-2.8-turbo.English_SadTeen`
- **Key finding:** The TELNYX_API_KEY in shell env is stale. Must use key from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

### Key Risk
Voice agent is the foundation. Everything builds on it. If the Telnyx AI Assistants API payload is wrong, we'll need to fix before anything else works. Testing is priority #1 once Cloudflare's back.
